## ⚠️ Warnings & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **🔴 CRITICAL: Commit or Stash Changes**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Commit changes
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: Complete app to src migration"
   
   # Option 2: Stash temporarily
   git stash push -m "WIP: App migration changes"
   ```

2. **🟡 HIGH: Push to Remote**
   ```bash
   # After committing, push the 19 commits
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **🟡 MEDIUM: Review Remote Branches**
   - Check `origin/feature/video-portfolio` for potential merge
   - Investigate updated `origin/feature/ai-images` 

4. **🟢 LOW: Clean Up Merged Branches**
   ```bash
   # Delete local merged branches
   git branch -d backup/emergency-20250125
   git branch -d feature/ai-images
   git branch -d fix/add-profile-assets
   ```

### Line Ending Warning

## 📋 Recommended Action Plan

### Priority Order (DO NOT MERGE WITHOUT APPROVAL)

1. **Review uncommitted changes** - Ensure all deleted files are intentional
2. **Commit current changes** - Clean working directory
3. **Push to remote** - Sync the 19 commits
4. **Review new feature branch** - Check video-portfolio feature
5. **Clean up branches** - Delete merged local branches
6. **Monitor remote updates** - Watch for team changes

## 🔐 Safety Notes

As requested, **NO MERGES** will be performed without your explicit approval. All operations suggested above are safe and reversible. The repository is in a manageable state with no conflicts, just needs synchronization.

## 📞 Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Help commit the current changes with appropriate message?
2. Review the new video-portfolio feature branch?
3. Clean up the merged local branches?
4. Investigate why feature/ai-images was updated remotely?

**Note**: I will not perform any merge operations without your explicit approval.
